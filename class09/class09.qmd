# 1. Importing candy data

Today we will analyze some data from 538 about typical Halloween candy.

Our first job is to get the data an read it into R

```{r}
candy <-read.csv("candy-data.csv",row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

ANS: There are 85 different candy types

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

>Q. How many chocolate candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

ANS: There are 38 fruity candies`

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
> Q. How many total candy?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q. How many variables/dimensions are there?

```{r}
ncol(candy)
```

# What is your favorate candy?

## Data Exploration

Folks like the skimr package for a first wee peak into a new dataset, Let's see what it does for this candy dataset


> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

ANS: My favorite candy is Snickers and its winpercent value is 76.67%

```{r}
candy["Snickers",]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

ANS: 76.76%

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, the winpercent column

```{r}
library("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Zero represents the abscense of chocolate in a specific candy, while 1 means that the candy has chocolate.


> Q. What are the five least liked candy's in the dataset?

```{r}
inds<-order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,],5)
```

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,],5)
```

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)

```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

ANS: No

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

ANS: Below 50%

```{r}
median(candy$winpercent)
```

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

ANS: Higher ranked

- First find all chocolate candy(subset)
- Get their winpercent values
- Summarize these values into one metric

-Do the same for fruity candy and compare

```{r}
idx<-candy$chocolate==1
choco_data<-candy[idx,]
mean_choco<-mean(choco_data$winpercent)
mean_choco

idx<-candy$fruity==1
fruity_data<-candy[idx,]
mean_fruity<-mean(fruity_data$winpercent)
mean_fruity

```

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

ANS: Yes

```{r}
t.test(choco_data$winpercent,fruity_data$winpercent)
```

# Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

ANS: Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble and Jawbusters

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?'

ANS: Snickers, Kit Kat, Twix, Reese's Miniatures, Reese's Peanut Butter cup

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

Plots of overall candy rankings

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```


```{r}

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent",y=NULL)

ggsave("barplot.png",h=10,width=7)


```


we can now insert any image using markdown syntax. This is ! followed by square brackets and then normal brackets. The result is shown as @fig-gray

![A dull plot](barplot.png){#fig-gray}

# Time to add some useful color

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),fill=as.factor(chocolate)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent",y=NULL)
```

We need to make our own color vector with the colors we like
```{r}
my_cols<-rep("black",nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"

```


```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)+
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent",y=NULL)

ggsave("barplot2.png",h=10,width=7)
```


![This is some caption text](barplot2.png){#fig-bar}

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

ANS: Sixlets


> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

ANS: Starburst

# Taking a look at pricepercent

As shown in {@fig-bar} there is some ugly ass colors to pick from in R. This is better than {@fig-gray}

Let's male a plot of winpercent vs pricepercent. The original idea with this 538 plot was to show you the best candy to get for your money as your shop for halloween

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,pricepercent,label=rownames(candy))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text(col=my_cols)
```

These labels suck. Let's try ggrepel.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 10)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

ANS: Reese's Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

ANS: 5 Most expensive: Nik L Nip, Nestle smarties, Ring pop, Mr Good Bar, Hershey's Special Dark. The least popular is Nik L Nip. 


## Explore the correlation structure in candy data

We will calculate all Pearson correlation values

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij<-cor(candy)
head(cij)
```



```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

ANS: Chocolate and fruity

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

ANS: winpercent and chocolate

# Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy,scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2])
```

We can change the plotting character and add some color:

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

Let's make a nicer graph using ggplot

```{r}
pc.score.results<-as.data.frame(pca$x)
ggplot(pc.score.results)+
  aes(PC1,PC2,label=rownames(pc.score.results))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols,max.overlaps=8)+
  labs(title="PCA Candy Space", subtitle="Chocolate and fruity candy separation")
```


loadings plot

```{r}
pc.loadings<-as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(pc.loadings) + 
  aes(PC1,reorder(rownames(pc.loadings),PC1))+
  geom_col()
```

>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

ANS: Fruity, pluribus, hard. It makes sense since most of the fruity candy are hard and are sold in a pluribus presentation.
